                              Game of Arms is a look inside the raw and highly competitive world of American arm wrestling. The series follows the members of five regional arm wrestling clubs in Erie, PA, Kansas City, KS, New York, NY, Sacramento, CA and Baton Rouge, LA as they hit the road and wager their reputation, relationships and money for the sport. Game of Arms not only focuses on the technique and skill in this high-stakes world, but also the family, careers and personal struggles of each man outside of the sport. Each episode features a dramatic regional match, leading to a tournament finale where the entire cast will compete for prize money and bragging rights.

                              The series hails from Matt Renner and Ethan Prochnik, the Emmy Award-winning producers of Deadliest Catch, and executive producer Dan Ilani, their partner in Undertow Films.

Those of you who watch NFL Network and see the NFL Game of the Week are probably asking, What makes an NFL Game of the Week? There are many factors involved.  It could be a record-setting performance or a great rivalry.  Most of the time, it is the games that go down to the final seconds. Starting in 1965, NFL Films produced NFL Game of the Week to showcase the league's biggest contest.  It started out as the last reminder of the old newsreels.  These shows were packaged for air less than 24 hours after the game was played.  This was the pattern established for the show's first 22 years (1965-1986). Production of the old NFL Game of the Week presented its drawbacks.  Facilities were so primitive that the slightest mistake in a narration meant starting over.  This did not sit well with the proven sportscasters brought in to narrate the shows. NFL Game of the Week found its mark around 1970, wh</Overview>

                              The video game revolution has been under way for decades, progressing from simple amusements created in the 1950s to an all-pervasive force in today's popular culture that rivals â€” and will perhaps soon surpass â€” film and television. What began as a subculture pastime has evolved and transcended genres to become a unique form of expression impacting everything from modern warfare to interpersonal relationships.

                              Rise of the Video Game is a comprehensive and progressive exploration of the past, present and future of video games and video gamers. From the early days of Pong to today's ever-popular Halo 2, and from Atari 2600 to Nintendo to PlayStation, Rise of the Video Game tells the story of the people, the ideologies and the technology behind video games and how they have exploded into a cultural phenomenon. The evolution of gaming has seen the pendulum move from the days of games replicating society, to society replicating games. Featuring interviews with giants in the gaming industry of yesterday and today, this five-part series examines the evolution of the video game and its cultural impact on the world of entertainment today.

The last remaining player is the champion, and the total garnets held by the champion will be the final prize.</Overview>

Each of the three stars of the show, Gene Barry, Robert Stack and Tony Franciosa were featured in their own self-contained episodes.  The connection between them was Howard Publications, a Los Angeles based publishing empire that had been built up from scratch by its dynamic owner, Glenn Howard. Howard's position of power, his confrontations with business and political enemies, and his own flamboyant lifestyle were portrayed in his portion of The Name of the Game. Within the Howard empire were investigative correspondent Jeff Dillon and editor Dan Farrell. Dillon was a super-agressive former newsboy who had clawed his way up to a position of power and respect working for Howard's People Magazine. Farrell was a former FBI agent who had gone into the publishing business because it provided a position from which to make the public aware of the threats posed by organized crime.</Overview>

                              Driven by sheer vanity, KO CHING MAN (Kate Tsui) takes part in a beauty pageant despite the strong opposition of her mother, a long-retired actress named CHEUNG LAI HUNG (Yuen King Tan), and leaps to stardom soon after winning the championship.
